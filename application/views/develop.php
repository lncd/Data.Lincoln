<p>If you're a developer and you want to use our data, feel free. Just make sure that you follow the terms of the data's licence and you're all set &ndash; and we'd love to hear if you build something cool.</p>

<h3>Want More?</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to build something a bit more in-depth than is possible with our regular Open Data downloads. Fortunately, we've got a whole set of APIs which let you tap into our data in far more depth, and an OAuth authentication system which lets you both authenticate University staff and students and interact with their data.</p>

<p>If you're interested in using our APIs, just drop us an email.</p>
