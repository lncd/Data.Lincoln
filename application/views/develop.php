<p>We encourage developers to take our data and build something amazing with it, so don't hold back. We'd love to hear about anything that you've made using our data!</p>

<h3>Want More?</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to build something a bit more in-depth than is possible with our published Open Data. Fortunately, we've got a whole set of APIs which let you tap into our data in far more depth, and an OAuth authentication system which lets you both authenticate people at the University and interact with their data.</p>

<p>If you're interested in using our APIs, just drop us an email.</p>
